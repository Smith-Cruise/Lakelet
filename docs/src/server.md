# Server

The optional `[server]` table configures the DataFusion query engine runtime.

```toml
[server]
memory-limit = "4GB"
server-port = 32010
```

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `memory-limit` | String | No | 80% of effective total memory | Caps the memory available to the query engine. |
| `server-port` | Integer | No | 32010 | Port the server started by `--server` listens on; Flight SQL and the web UI share it. |

The `memory-limit` value is an integer with an optional, case-insensitive unit. With no unit, the value is treated as bytes.
